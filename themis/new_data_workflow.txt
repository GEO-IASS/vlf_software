New Data Workflow

*** NEW DATA FROM WEN LI***

1. Put it in the right folders on scott at data/spacecraft/themis/level3/density
2. Run batch_collect_dens_data.m. This will turn the density data into .mat files in the case_studies/themis_emissions/derived_densities directory
3. Resample the density data onto SCM epochs using resample_densities_onto_scm_epochs.m. This will put _dens_common files in case_studies/themis_emissions/fb_scm1
4. If necessary, recombine the THEMIS and Polar data using themis_polar/combine_them_polar.m.


*** TO GET NEW DFB DATA, DO THIS ***
o Go to ftp://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/istp/themis/tha/l2/fbk/
o Download all the junk into scott/spacecraft/themis/level2/dfb/tha
o Repeat for other probes

Here's a quick way to use the Linux FTP command to do all this.
Log into scott
cd /data/spacecraft/themis/level2/dfb/tha
mkdir 2011
cd 2011
ftp cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov
username: anonymous
password: dgolden1@stanford.edu
prompt
cd /pub/istp/themis/tha/l2/fbk/2011/
mget *.cdf

Repeat for other years and probes using "cd" (remote change dir), "lcd" (local change dir), "!" (run command on local computer)


*** IF YOU GET NEW DFB DATA, DO THIS ***

o Stuff the data on scott
o Run batch_collect_dfb_data.m
o Run batch_clean_dfb.m
o Run resample_densities_onto_scm_epochs.m

*** IF YOU GET NEW QD DATA ***
o Update ae_1min.mat
o resample_qd_data.m
o Download new ASY_SYM data and run asy_sym_collect_files.m

*** TO GET NEW EPHEMERIS DATA ***
YES
o ftp://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/istp/themis/tha/ssc
o Download CDFs to /media/scott/spacecraft/themis/ephemeris/cdf/tha
o Repeat for other SCs
o Run batch_collect_ephemeris.m

NO
o Go to http://sscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/Locator.cgi
o Choose THEMIS, start time 2007 001, end time, 2012 001 (or whatever)
o Points are every minute. In the past, I've done 1 out of every 60 points (one hour), which is a little over 1 MB/SC/year. 1 out of every 10 points would be fine too.
o Copy and paste into text files

*** TO RE-RUN THE CHORUS MODEL ***

o combine_them_polar.m
o select_and_save_features.m
o per_bin_regress_them_polar.m
o make_chorus_hiss_wave_map_movie.m
