The cross-sections for N2 ionization into X2 and A2 for E=2000,4000,7000
and 10000 eV are from http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/Ionization/table.pl?ionization=N2

The cross-section at E=1500 is also corrected with NIST value (it
was an outlier)
We subtracted from NIST data the N2+ B2 cross-section.
For singlet states, E=1500 .. 10000 is cross-seciton for N2+ (X2 and A2)
scaled.
